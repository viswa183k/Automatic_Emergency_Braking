# Automatic Emergency Braking System  

### 📌 Overview  
This project implements an **Automatic Emergency Braking (AEB) system** for vehicles. It uses an **ultrasonic sensor** to detect nearby obstacles and immediately stops the motor while sounding a buzzer to avoid collisions.  

### ⚡ Features  
- Real-time obstacle detection  
- Automatic motor shutdown when too close  
- Buzzer warning for driver  
- Enhances automotive safety  

### 🛠️ Components Required  
- Arduino UNO  
- HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor  
- L298N Motor Driver  
- DC Motor  
- Buzzer  
- Power Supply & Wires  

### 🚗 Applications  
- Automatic emergency braking in cars  
- Safety in semi-autonomous vehicles  
- Preventive crash avoidance systems
